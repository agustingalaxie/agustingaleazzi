                    My name is Agustin Galeazzi. I was born in Junin, Buenos Aires, Argentina. I moved to Rosario to study History and play rugby. An enjury left me off the 
                    fields and away from sports for a long time, and with time I realized that writing about history wasn't quite my thing, so I started to learn coding,
                    first self-taught, an later in an institute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for my former jobs, I always worked where I could, from painter and blacksmith to community manager.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I like running, calisthenics, reading and playing ttrpgs with my friends.

                    <h3>Instituto Superior J. J. Urquiza</h3>
                    <h6>Software development technician</h6>
                    <p>Understanding that to become a professional developer one needs to have
                        a deep formation, I started this career, of which I am going through the first year. 
                        This institute is known for training excellent professionals who are requested by top-level companies.

                    <h3>Self-taught and online courses</h3>
                    <p>I did several freeCodeCamp and CodeCademy courses, in HTML, CSS, Javascript and ReactJS. The certificates can be found in my Linkedin profile. 
                        Now im taking part of an intensive Java FullStack developer course, dictated by Egg Cooperation, thanks to a scholarship granted by my government. This course makes
                        particular emphasis on soft skills, such as collaboration in problem resolving and team communication.
